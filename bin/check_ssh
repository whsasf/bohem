# Script contains a simple call to verify if a remote system is reachanble
# without the need for a password. It was decided to implement this admitedly
# simplistic call in this form, for the following reasons:
# 1) If everything that needs this, uses this, then it is very simple to change
# only this one script rather than everything.
# 2) It is not going to used _that_ often, and so it does not need to reside in
# memory (as a bohem module).
#
# Usage:
#  check_ssh "<user>@<server>"
#  This takes only one variable: the username and server name in the same format
#  as what is normally passed to ssh.
