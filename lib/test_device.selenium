### This script adds a device to the UI and verifies that it has been added correctly.
### This script is good for 8.0, 8.5, 8.5.1 (the latest version at the time of writing)
###
### Before running this test, you need to set the following five variables in your environment:
### 
### DEVICE_NAME           -- Name as it appears in the UI on the add-device page
### DEVICE_MANUFACTURER   -- Manufacturer name as it appears in the UI after device is added
### DEVICE_MODEL          -- Model number as it appears in the UI after device is added
### DEVICE_XML            -- Model number as it appears in the server mappings file
### domain                -- A domain name to use for the test case
###
