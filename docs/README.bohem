The (very) Quick-start guide:

1. bohem is stored at ssh://git@bitbucket.org/openwave/bohem (previously at $CVSROOT:qa/tools/bohem).
2. bohem is not embedded together with a test suite. You need to check out a test suite
separately.
3. You need to create a variables file (either in current directory user.vars, or
etc/user.vars), specifying all parametrized items in the test suite, as well
some items that bohem needs. The file will be very similar to etc/global.vars.
The most important variable to bohem is $WORK_DIR, which points to the root of where you
checked out the test suite in #2.
4. You need to create a test list pointing bohem to all the test cases that you want it to
run. There are several test lists in share/.
5. To run bohem, execute 'bin/run_tests <test-list>'.
6. bohem source is fairly well commented. Good luck.
